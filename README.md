# Mobile-First Bootstrap Grid

A mobile-first version of the Twitter Bootstrap grid and layout scaffolding. The Twitter Bootstrap grid starts with desktop styles by default and uses media queries to change the layout for mobile and large screens. This version starts with mobile styles first and uses media queries to add layout for larger screens.


## Usage

Link to the mobile-first-bootstrap.css file in the head of your document. For example,

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile-first-bootstrap.css" />
```
